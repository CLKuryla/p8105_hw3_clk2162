# Problem 1

Load data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

Explore and describe dataset.

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations.

``` r
# Check out the structure of the data set 
head(instacart)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 15
    ##   order_id product_id add_to_cart_order reordered user_id eval_set order_number
    ##      <int>      <int>             <int>     <int>   <int> <chr>           <int>

This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns. The column names are
order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set,
order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order,
product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department. It is in a
long format, and the order_id is not distinct. Each row in the datas et
represents a particular item purchased and contains corresponding
information about it. There are 131209 distinct orders, 131209 users (so
it seems to be one order per user), containing a total of 39123
products.

``` r
# aisles and number of times they occur (number of times there is an order from the aisle)
# arrange with most ordered from aisles at the top
aisles_df <- instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(aisles_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 2
    ##   aisle                              n
    ##   <chr>                          <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ## 4 yogurt                         55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese                41699
    ## 6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617

There are 134 aisles. The aisles most ordered from are:

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

# Problem 2

This problem has to do with several things, we are focusing on self
reported health over locations and years.

Load data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

Clean data

``` r
brfss_smart2010_overall_health <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr) %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))

#brfss_smart2010_overall_health_excellent_poor <- brfss_smart2010_overall_health %>%
#  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Poor"))
  # include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” ???????

knitr::kable(head(brfss_smart2010_overall_health, n = 20))
```

From these visualizations, we can see that the most common responses are
generally “Good” and “Very good.” Usually, “Very good” is more common
than “Good,” except for some years and locations, such as Kings and
Queens Counties in 2006 and Bronx County in 2010 (there is no data for
the Bronx in 2006). In 2010, more counties were surveyed than in 2006.

## Problem 3

This problem has to do with accelerometers in observational studies and
clinical trials.

Load, clean, and tidy data.

``` r
nhanes_accel <- read_csv("./data/nhanes_accel.csv")
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
nhanes_covar <- read_csv("./data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4)
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 5
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (5): SEQN, sex, age, BMI, education
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
nhanes_accel <- nhanes_accel %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(seqn = as.character(seqn)) 
  
nhanes_covar <- nhanes_covar %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(age > 21) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(age) & !is.na(sex) & !is.na(bmi) & !is.na(education)) %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex)) %>% 
  mutate(education = as.character(education)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex,
                          "1" ~ "male",
                          "2" ~ "female")) %>% 
  mutate(education = case_match(education,
                                "1" ~ "less_than_high_school",
                                "2" ~ "high_school_equivalent",
                                "3" ~ "more_than_high_school")) %>%
  mutate(education = fct_relevel(education, c("less_than_high_school", "high_school_equivalent", "more_than_high_school"))) %>% 
  mutate(seqn = as.character(seqn)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex))
  

# combine the two dfs

nhanes_df <- inner_join(nhanes_covar, nhanes_accel, by = "seqn")
```

Now we will explore the education distribution over demographic
variables.

``` r
# Table showing the number of men and women in each education category

education_sex <- nhanes_covar %>% 
  select(sex, education) %>% 
  group_by(education, sex) %>%
  count(education, sex) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex,
              values_from = n)

knitr::kable(education_sex)
```

| education              | female | male |
|:-----------------------|-------:|-----:|
| less_than_high_school  |     28 |   27 |
| high_school_equivalent |     23 |   34 |
| more_than_high_school  |     59 |   54 |

From the table, we see that the most common education level is more than
high school. The distributions are relatively similar between sexes,
except that there are substantially more males than females in the high
school equivalent category.

``` r
# visualization of the age distributions for men and women in each education category

library(ggridges)

nhanes_covar %>%
 # ggplot(aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
 # geom_violin(aes(color = education, alpha = 0.5))
#  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(title = "Age distributions of men and women by education") +
  facet_grid(~education)
```

![](p8105_hw3_clk2162_files/figure-gfm/q3_education_age_sex-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
nhanes_covar %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color = education, alpha = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Age distributions of men and women by education") 
```

![](p8105_hw3_clk2162_files/figure-gfm/q3_education_age_sex-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#  facet_grid(~sex)
```

From these plots, we can see that there are more women below 40 who are
in the more than high school category than men, and that in that
category, the ages skew younger. In the less than high school category,
the ages skew older, and are relatively similar across gender. For the
high school equivalent category, there males are generally younger than
the females.

Now, look at total activity for participants.

``` r
# Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences. Comment on your plot.

mims_df <- nhanes_df %>%
  pivot_longer("min1":"min1440",
               names_to = "minute",
               values_to = "mims") %>%
  group_by(seqn) %>% 
  summarise(total_activity = sum(mims))

mims_and_demographics <- inner_join(mims_df, nhanes_covar, by = "seqn")
  
# plot the data

mims_and_demographics %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total activity by demographics") +
  facet_grid(~ education)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw3_clk2162_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

From this plot we can see that in high school equivalent and more than
high school, the females tend to have more activity, while in the less
than high school it is similar. In the less than highschool, activity
decreases sharply after 60 for both sexes.

Now let’s explore the data by timecourse.

``` r
timecourse_df <- nhanes_df %>% 
  pivot_longer("min1":"min1440",
               names_to = "minute",
               values_to = "mims") %>% 
  mutate(minute = substr(minute, 4, nchar(minute))) %>%
  mutate(minute = as.numeric(minute))

timecourse_df %>% 
  group_by(seqn) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = mims, color = sex)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~education) +
  labs(title = "24 Hour Timecourse Activity")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_clk2162_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that for all education levels, the general trend is similar,
with activity low during times when people would be asleep, and high
during the day. It is similar for both sexes, although in more than high
school groups, the women are slightly more active.
